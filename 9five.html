            <p class="para">
              9Five was winning. They had the ultimate advantage: Product-market
              fit. The Greek market was responding well to the brand’s modern
              designs and lifestyle-first marketing approach. However, the
              challenge was that the store’s growth was largely fueled by the
              Founder, who was strong in media buying. That put a hard limit on
              the brand’s potential to grow.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              The ads were impossible to scale after a certain volume. Exploring
              new channels like YouTube and Google Ads wasn’t going as smoothly
              as 9Five hoped, and growth was starting to halt. When we started
              working with the brand, we decided we’d focus on tackling two main
              challenges.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="solution each_main_description_block">
          <p class="section_title">The Solution</p>
          <div class="section_description">
            <p class="para">
              First, we’d make the email marketing channel a big revenue and
              profit contributor. This added cash in the pocket would then allow
              the brand to reinvest more in advertising, scale its social, and
              diversify in new channels more effectively. Secondly, we’d do
              everything in a fully automated way. Not just the core automation
              like cart and checkout abandonment. But also more advanced
              journeys, such as passive user research, review collection, and
              even highly personalized, plain-text “check-up” campaigns (a
              shockingly underutilized technique to enhance the shopper’s
              experience and boost deliverability).
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              A huge buying block for shopping for sunglasses online is the
              inability to know whether they’d fit your face without trying them
              on. Working together with the brand, we developed an on-site
              “quiz-like” experience that allowed the users to select the most
              appropriate glasses based on their facial bone structure and
              gender.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              It was a campaign that matched the user’s needs perfectly. Even
              though we hacked it together in a couple of hours using nothing
              more than WordPress’s Elementor Pro, the results speak for
              themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              The campaign topped at a 38% conversion rate and averaged a 20.5%
              conversion rate over a 7-month period, But here’s the best part.
              We used this opportunity to also collect zero-party data from the
              subscribers. In the future, this means we’d be able to make
              personalized recommendations based on the user’s gender and facial
              structure.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              We created the core e-commerce flows. This included retargeting
              automation, such as cart and browse abandonment flows. It included
              onboarding journeys for new subscribers and post-purchase
              sequences that ensured the shopper’s expectations were met. The
              difference is in how we executed this automation.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              Online shopping lacks the human touch offered in brick-and-mortar
              stores. Apart from that, when it comes to eyewear specifically,
              each subscriber has different needs and styles. Even though the
              price point is not high, there is anxiety.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              The way we alleviated that anxiety was through highly personalized
              content. The automation pushed new sales, yes, but they also
              checked how the shopper was doing, whether they were happy with
              their purchase, what new products the brand ought to develop, and
              more.
            </p>
            <p class="para">
              The Greek e-commerce market is thriving but years behind in
              marketing innovation. This was a highly unusual experience for
              Greek shoppers. They responded in an extremely positive way.
              First, by shopping. In as little as 90 days, email marketing was
              contributing 20% to the store’s total revenue. Secondly, by
              replying to the brand’s emails, giving feedback, reviewing
              products, and actively engaging with the brand’s content in other
              channels.
